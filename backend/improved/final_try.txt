Once upon a time, in a small village nestled among
rolling hills, there lived a man named John. He
was a farmer, his weathered hands calloused from
years of tending the land, and he worked hard
every day, rain or shine. His farm wasn't vast,
but it yielded enough to support his family, a
small but loving group led by his wife, Mary. Mary
was a woman known for her kindness, always ready
to lend a helping hand to her neighbours in times
of need.  One sunny morning, John decided to take
his surplus vegetables to the bustling market in
the nearby town. He loaded his sturdy wooden cart
with plump tomatoes, crisp lettuce, and carrots
bursting with colour. The journey was long and the
road was rough, making it a struggle to keep the
cart from tipping over, but John persevered, his
determination fueled by the promise of a good
sale. Finally, he reached the market square and
set up his stall, his vegetables gleaming under
the morning sun.  As he was arranging his produce,
a young girl, her clothes threadbare and her eyes
filled with a quiet hunger, approached him. "Sir,"
she said, her voice barely a whisper, "can you
please give me some vegetables? I have no money to
buy food."  John's heart went out to her. He
couldn't bear to see such hardship, so he
generously gave her a handful of carrots and a few
potatoes.  The girl's eyes lit up with gratitude.
"Thank you, sir," she said, her voice now filled
with hope. "May God bless you."  She then skipped
away, a small ray of sunshine in the midst of the
market's bustle.  The day passed quickly, and
John, with a satisfied smile, packed up his stall.
Most of his vegetables had found new homes,
bringing him a good profit. As he prepared to
leave, however, he realised his wallet was
missing. Panic surged through him. He searched
everywhere, frantically digging through his cart,
checking his pockets, but his wallet was nowhere
to be found. His heart sank, the day's joy
replaced with worry. What was he to do?  Just
then, the young girl he had helped earlier
approached him, her eyes wide. "Sir," she said, "I
saw a man take your wallet. He ran into the
forest. He looked like he was trying to hide
something."  John's hope flickered back to life.
He thanked the girl profusely and, with renewed
energy, dashed into the forest, the girl's words
echoing in his mind. He searched diligently,
following the path the girl had described. After a
while, he spotted the man who had stolen his
wallet, trying to make his escape.  John
confronted him, demanding the return of his
wallet. The man, caught red-handed, had no choice
but to comply.  John returned to the market, his
heart filled with gratitude. He found the young
girl and, overcome with joy, gave her even more
vegetables, along with a small amount of money.
From that day on, John never forgot the kindness
of the young girl. He always remembered her
generosity and the lesson she had taught him. He
vowed to always be kind and helpful, just as she
had been to him, sharing his good fortune with
those in need.
